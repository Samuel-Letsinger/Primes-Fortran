# Primes Fortran
This code uses a function that finds two prime numbers that make up a number, This can be used to decrypt encrypted data but ofc its slower than it needs to be.

7 and 11 are both prime and when multiplied together 77 is what's given. using a guess (g) of 8 you'll be able to get 7 and 11 all using math, this is the same algorithm used to decrypt and encrypt data, but they use huge prime numbers so it'll take a very long time if done with a number that big.
